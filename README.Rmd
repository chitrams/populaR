populaR provides a convenient interface to the UN's [World Population Prospects](https://population.un.org/wpp/) API. Several pre-baked datasets are included, as well as a convenient wrapper for more advanced API users

## Installation

You can install the development version of populaR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("chitrams/populaR")
```

## Example

First you have to get the numeric ID of a location. You can do this through the `get_id` function with `type = "locations"`. If you know the exact wording, set `search = FALSE` to speed up the query.

```{r example}
library(populaR)
get_id("Australia", type = "locations", .progress = FALSE)
```

Then, you need the numeric ID of the indicator. You can search for this in the same way

```{r example-indicator}
get_id("Population by 5-year age groups and sex", type = "Indicators", .progress = FALSE)
```

Common indicators include:

```{r common-indicators, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(
  tibble::tribble(
    ~`Indicator ID`, ~Description,
    46, "Population by 5-year age groups and sex"
  )
)
```

By default, the package does not clean API columns, and so will return quite a lot of information.
